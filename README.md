## Description about the project
This project is a game developed in Java, using JavaFX for creating graphical elements. The theme of the game was chosen by the team and will be based on the game Asteroids. Therefore, it is necessary to create a game interface that contains a spaceship that responds to the mouse cursor for rotation and to the WASD controls for movement. In addition to the spaceship, there will be asteroids that move randomly, which are the objective of the game, as the spaceship can shoot projectiles. When a shot hits and destroys an asteroid, the player's score increases. However, if an asteroid collides with the spaceship, it explodes and the game ends.

There will also be an initial screen and a pause screen. The initial screen is where the menu is located to start a new game, and the pause screen, which can be accessed during the game and allows the player to pause the execution of the game.
